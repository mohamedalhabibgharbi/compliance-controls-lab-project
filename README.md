## üß™ Exercise Summary

To complete the controls assessment checklist, information from the scope, goals, and risk assessment report was used. Control categories were referenced to understand the type and purpose of each control.

The goal: assess whether Botium Toys has the necessary controls in place.

## ‚úÖ Controls Assessment Checklist

| Yes | No  | Control                                         | Explanation |
|-----|-----|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|     | X   | **Least Privilege**                             | All employees can access customer data; access should be restricted to reduce breach risk. |
| X   |     | **Disaster Recovery Plans**                     | Not yet implemented. Required to ensure business continuity. |
| X   |     | **Password Policies**                           | Current password requirements are weak, increasing the risk of compromise. |
| X   |     | **Separation of Duties**                        | Currently, the CEO handles payroll and daily ops‚Äîthis must be separated. |
| X   |     | **Firewall**                                    | A firewall is in place with defined rules. |
|     | X   | **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**            | Needed to detect potential intrusions. |
|     | X   | **Backups**                                     | Backups are needed to support business continuity during a breach. |
| X   |     | **Antivirus Software**                          | Installed and regularly monitored. |
|     | X   | **Legacy System Maintenance**                   | Legacy systems are monitored but lack a clear maintenance schedule. |
|     | X   | **Encryption**                                  | Not currently used; critical for confidentiality of sensitive info. |
|     | X   | **Password Management System**                  | Not in place; would help with secure and efficient password management. |
| X   |     | **Locks (Physical Security)**                   | Physical locations are secured with locks. |
| X   |     | **CCTV Surveillance**                           | CCTV installed and functioning. |
