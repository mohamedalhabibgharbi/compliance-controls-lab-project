| Separation of Duties | ‚ùå | CEO handles daily ops **and** payroll‚Äîfraud risk. |
| Firewall | ‚úÖ | Enforces traffic rules. |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS) | ‚ùå | Needed to spot intrusions quickly. |
| Backups | ‚ùå | Critical data not backed up regularly. |
| Antivirus Software | ‚úÖ | Installed and monitored. |
| Legacy-System Maintenance | ‚ùå | No formal schedule or procedures. |
| Encryption | ‚ùå | Not used for sensitive data. |
| Password-Management System | ‚ùå | Would improve secure credential storage. |
| Physical Locks | ‚úÖ | Office, storefront, and warehouse secured. |
| CCTV Surveillance | ‚úÖ | Cameras installed and functioning. |
| Fire Detection / Prevention | ‚úÖ | Alarms and sprinklers operational. |
